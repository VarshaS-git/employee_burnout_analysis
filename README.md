**Employee Burnout Prediction using KNN**

A machine learning project to predict employee burnout based on work-related and psychological factors using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This model achieved a prediction accuracy of **91%** and aims to help organizations proactively manage employee well-being.

Overview :
Employee burnout is a critical issue impacting productivity and mental health in the workplace. This project uses Python to:
- Analyze and visualize employee fatigue and work trends
- Preprocess real-world HR data
- Train a KNN classifier to predict burnout levels

Features :
- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, standardization)
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- ✅ KNN model implementation and tuning with Scikit-learn
- ✅ Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- ✅ Insights for improving employee management strategies

Dataset :
The dataset includes fields such as:
- Date of Joining
- Gender
- Company Type (Product/Service)
- Work-from-Home Availability
- Designation Level
- Resource Allocation
- Mental Fatigue Score
- Burnout Level (target variable)

Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
 
Results :
- Model Accuracy: 91%
- Best K value: Tuned via grid search
- Key Insight: Mental fatigue and lack of WFH setup were highly correlated with burnout.
